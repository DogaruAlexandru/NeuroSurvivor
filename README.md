# NeuroSurvival (Work in Progress)

**Master's Project – Procedural Action-Survival Game**  
*Technologies: C++, SDL3, Python, Generative AI, Linux (WSL)*

NeuroSurvival is a 2D action-survival game currently under development as a master’s thesis project. Inspired by *Vampire Survivors*, the game is written in C++ using SDL3 for rendering and input, with a Python-based generative AI system that creates dynamic enemies and items.

## Planned Features

- AI-generated enemies with unique behaviors and attributes  
- Procedurally generated items and power-ups  
- Python scripting for dynamic content integration  
- High replayability through generative variation  

## Technologies

- C++ for game logic and engine systems  
- SDL3 for graphics, input, and window management  
- Python for scripting and generative AI components  
- Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL) for development  


## Goals

- Explore generative AI in a game development context  
- Design a modular engine with support for scripted AI behavior  
- Deliver a playable prototype as part of a master’s thesis
